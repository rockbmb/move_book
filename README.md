# Sketchbook for the [Move book](https://move-book.com/index.html)

This repository contains some notes taken as I read through a resource on the [Move
language](https://diem-developers-components.netlify.app/papers/diem-move-a-language-with-programmable-resources/2020-05-26.pdf).

Since Diem has shut down and Move has since been adopted by other projects with their own variants
of the language, and tooling, the original tooling used to run the book's examples is no longer
working.

As such, none of the code follows the required "module/script" separation, and cannot be run.

The important parts are the notes and comments - e.g. those marked with `IMPORTANT` - left throughout.
